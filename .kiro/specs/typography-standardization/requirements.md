# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current typography system lacks consistency and hierarchy, leading to poor readability and user experience issues. This feature will establish a standardized typography system with clear font size hierarchy, consistent weights, and improved mobile readability to create a more professional and accessible interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and readable typography throughout the application, so that I can easily scan and understand content without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL use a consistent font size hierarchy with Display at 64px, H1 at 48px, H2 at 36px, H3 at 24px, Lead at 20px, Body at 18px, and Caption at 12px
2. WHEN viewing content on desktop THEN all headings SHALL use font-weight 700 and body text SHALL use font-weight 400, with variable font support for weight interpolation
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the typography SHALL follow a modular scale with 1.333 ratio for mathematical harmony
4. WHEN comparing similar content sections THEN font sizes SHALL be consistent across all pages
5. WHEN viewing hero sections THEN display typography SHALL create maximum visual impact
6. WHEN reading intro paragraphs THEN lead text SHALL provide clear content hierarchy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want readable body text that doesn't strain my eyes, so that I can comfortably consume content on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing content on mobile devices THEN body text SHALL be a minimum of 16px font size
2. WHEN viewing on any screen size THEN typography SHALL use fluid sizing with clamp() and viewport units for smooth scaling
3. WHEN reading paragraphs THEN line height SHALL dynamically adjust based on font size for optimal readability
4. WHEN viewing headings on mobile THEN they SHALL scale appropriately while maintaining hierarchy
5. WHEN components are in containers THEN typography SHALL respond to container queries for component-level responsiveness
6. WHEN user prefers reduced motion THEN typography animations SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized typography system with excellent developer experience, so that I can consistently apply text styles without duplicating CSS rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new components THEN developers SHALL have access to predefined typography classes and a useTypography() hook for dynamic styling
2. WHEN updating typography THEN changes SHALL be applied from a single source of truth using CSS custom properties for runtime theming
3. WHEN building components THEN the typography system SHALL integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and provide CSS-in-JS fallback options
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN there SHALL be no hardcoded font sizes outside of the typography system
5. WHEN developing THEN VSCode SHALL provide typography snippets for rapid development
6. WHEN testing typography THEN developers SHALL have access to an interactive typography playground
7. WHEN migrating legacy code THEN automated codemods SHALL assist in updating typography
8. WHEN documenting THEN typography documentation SHALL be automatically generated from the token system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want clear visual hierarchy in the typography, so that users can easily distinguish between different levels of content importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a page THEN H1 headings SHALL be visually distinct and clearly the most prominent text
2. WHEN scanning content THEN H2 and H3 headings SHALL create clear content sections with appropriate visual weight
3. WHEN reading body text THEN it SHALL be clearly distinguishable from headings but remain highly readable
4. WHEN comparing heading levels THEN each level SHALL have sufficient contrast in size and weight to establish clear hierarchy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want typography that meets accessibility standards, so that I can use the application regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text content THEN all typography SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN heading hierarchy SHALL be properly structured (Display, H1, H2, H3 in logical order)
3. WHEN zooming to 200% THEN text SHALL remain readable and not overlap or become cut off
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN typography SHALL have dedicated overrides for enhanced readability
5. WHEN fonts load THEN font-size-adjust SHALL maintain x-height consistency across font families
6. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN focus-visible states SHALL provide clear typography emphasis
7. WHEN line height changes THEN it SHALL dynamically adjust based on font size for optimal readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast-loading typography that doesn't impact page performance, so that I can access content quickly regardless of my connection speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading fonts THEN the system SHALL use font subsetting for Bitcoin symbols and special characters
2. WHEN rendering above-fold content THEN critical CSS SHALL be extracted and inlined for typography
3. WHEN fonts are loading THEN variable fonts SHALL enable smooth weight interpolation without multiple font files
4. WHEN theme changes occur THEN CSS custom properties SHALL enable runtime theming without page reloads
5. WHEN fonts fail to load THEN the fallback stack SHALL maintain similar x-height and metrics
6. WHEN measuring performance THEN typography SHALL not add more than 50KB to the initial bundle

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust typography architecture, so that I can extend and maintain the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing typography themes THEN a Typography Context Provider SHALL handle theme variations
2. WHEN requiring dynamic styles THEN CSS-in-JS fallback SHALL be available for runtime requirements
3. WHEN aligning with design systems THEN a typography token system SHALL provide consistent naming
4. WHEN generating documentation THEN it SHALL be automatically created from the token definitions
5. WHEN extending typography THEN the architecture SHALL support plugin-based extensions
6. WHEN debugging typography THEN developer tools SHALL provide typography inspection capabilities
