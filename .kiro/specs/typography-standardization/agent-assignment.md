# Agent Assignment Strategy for Typography Standardization

## Overview
This document assigns specific specialized agents to each phase of the typography standardization project, optimizing for efficiency and expertise matching.

## Agent Assignments by Phase

### Phase 1: Core System & CSS Variables (Tasks 1-4)
**Primary Agent: `frontend-developer`**
- Expert in CSS architecture, CSS-in-JS, and design systems
- Handles CSS custom properties, fluid typography, and Tailwind configuration
- Tasks: 1, 2, 4

**Secondary Agent: `typescript-pro`**
- Creates type-safe token system with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Tasks: 3

**Rationale**: Frontend-developer has deep CSS expertise for foundational work, while typescript-pro ensures type safety from the start.

### Phase 2: Components & Hooks (Tasks 5-8)
**Primary Agent: `react-specialist`**
- Masters React patterns, hooks, and component architecture
- Implements Typography component, useTypography hook, and Context Provider
- Tasks: 5, 6, 7, 8

**Rationale**: React-specialist's expertise in modern React patterns and performance optimization is crucial for building reusable components.

### Phase 3: Performance & Optimization (Tasks 9-12)
**Primary Agent: `performance-engineer`**
- Optimizes font loading, subsetting, and critical CSS extraction
- Implements performance monitoring and budgets
- Tasks: 9, 10, 12

**Secondary Agent: `frontend-developer`**
- Handles CSS-in-JS fallback implementation
- Tasks: 11

**Rationale**: Performance-engineer ensures optimal loading times and resource usage, while frontend-developer handles runtime styling needs.

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Tasks 13-16)
**Primary Agent: `refactoring-specialist`**
- Creates automated codemods for migration
- Builds AST-based transformation scripts
- Tasks: 15

**Secondary Agent: `frontend-developer`**
- Builds interactive playground and VSCode snippets
- Tasks: 13, 14

**Secondary Agent: `typescript-pro`**
- Generates automated documentation from tokens
- Tasks: 16

**Rationale**: Refactoring-specialist ensures safe, systematic migration while frontend-developer creates developer tools.

### Phase 5: Migration & Integration (Tasks 17-20)
**Primary Agent: `refactoring-specialist`**
- Systematically migrates all components to new typography system
- Ensures backward compatibility where needed
- Tasks: 17, 18, 19, 20

**Support Agent: `code-reviewer`**
- Reviews migration changes for consistency and best practices
- Validates no hardcoded values remain

**Rationale**: Refactoring-specialist's systematic approach ensures complete migration without breaking changes.

### Phase 6: Accessibility & Testing (Tasks 21-24)
**Primary Agent: `qa-expert`**
- Implements comprehensive testing strategy
- Sets up visual regression and accessibility testing
- Tasks: 23, 24

**Secondary Agent: `frontend-developer`**
- Implements accessibility features (high-contrast, focus states)
- Tasks: 21, 22

**Rationale**: QA-expert ensures comprehensive testing coverage while frontend-developer implements accessibility features.

### Phase 7: Performance Monitoring (Tasks 25-27)
**Primary Agent: `performance-engineer`**
- Implements performance metrics and monitoring
- Optimizes font loading strategies
- Creates performance debugging tools
- Tasks: 25, 26, 27

**Rationale**: Performance-engineer's expertise ensures meeting all performance targets (LCP < 2.5s, bundle < 500KB).

### Phase 8: Final Polish (Tasks 28-30)
**Primary Agent: `code-reviewer`**
- Final code review and cleanup
- Ensures all requirements met
- Tasks: 29, 30

**Secondary Agent: `frontend-developer`**
- Completes documentation
- Tasks: 28

**Rationale**: Code-reviewer ensures final quality and compliance with all standards.

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Concurrent Work Streams
1. **Stream 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Phase 1 + Early Phase 2
   - `frontend-developer` and `typescript-pro` work in parallel
   - Foundation must be complete before components

2. **Stream 2 (Weeks 2-3)**: Phase 2 + Phase 3 prep
   - `react-specialist` builds components
   - `performance-engineer` prepares optimization strategy

3. **Stream 3 (Weeks 3-4)**: Phase 4 + Phase 5
   - `refactoring-specialist` handles migration
   - Developer tools built in parallel

4. **Stream 4 (Week 5)**: Phase 6 + Phase 7
   - Testing and monitoring run concurrently
   - Final validation and polish

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Token System** (Task 3) blocks component development
2. **Tailwind Config** (Task 4) must be complete before migration
3. **Typography Component** (Task 5) is prerequisite for all UI updates

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start Phase 1 with two agents in parallel
- Build migration codemods early (Task 15) to test on sample components
- Implement performance monitoring (Task 25) early to track impact

## Success Metrics

### Per-Agent KPIs
- **frontend-developer**: CSS bundle < 50KB typography overhead
- **react-specialist**: Component render time < 10ms
- **performance-engineer**: Font load time < 100ms
- **refactoring-specialist**: 100% migration coverage, zero breaking changes
- **qa-expert**: 100% test coverage, WCAG AAA compliance
- **code-reviewer**: Zero hardcoded values, all ESLint rules pass
