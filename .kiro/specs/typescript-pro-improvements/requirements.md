# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the TypeScript Pro agent's recommendations to enhance type safety, runtime validation, and overall code quality in the Bitcoin compensation plan application. The improvements focus on strengthening the type system with branded types, adding runtime schema validation, implementing comprehensive error handling, and optimizing build configuration for better developer experience and application reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want branded types for financial values, so that I can prevent calculation errors and ensure type safety when working with different currency units.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with Bitcoin amounts THEN the system SHALL use BTCAmount branded type with positive constraint
2. WHEN working with USD amounts THEN the system SHALL use USDAmount branded type with positive constraint  
3. WHEN working with Satoshi amounts THEN the system SHALL use SatoshiAmount branded type with positive constraint
4. WHEN converting between currency units THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe conversion functions
5. WHEN validating financial amounts THEN the system SHALL enforce positive value constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want runtime schema validation for API responses, so that I can catch data inconsistencies early and provide better error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving Bitcoin price API responses THEN the system SHALL validate the response structure using Zod schema
2. WHEN receiving Mempool API responses THEN the system SHALL validate transaction data against defined schemas
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive validation errors
4. WHEN API data is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide fallback values or graceful degradation
5. WHEN processing user inputs THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all input data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive error taxonomy system, so that I can handle different types of errors appropriately and provide better user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them as validation, api, calculation, or network errors
2. WHEN errors are retryable THEN the system SHALL indicate retry capability through error properties
3. WHEN displaying errors to users THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include context information for debugging
5. WHEN handling calculation errors THEN the system SHALL preserve calculation context for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced temporal type safety, so that I can prevent invalid date and time calculations in vesting schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with months THEN the system SHALL use Month branded type with range constraints (1-120)
2. WHEN working with years THEN the system SHALL use Year branded type with range constraints (2009-2050)
3. WHEN validating dates THEN the system SHALL use ValidDateString branded type
4. WHEN processing Bitcoin addresses THEN the system SHALL use BTCAddress branded type
5. WHEN performing temporal calculations THEN the system SHALL enforce valid date ranges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized TypeScript compiler configuration, so that I can have faster builds and better type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling TypeScript THEN the system SHALL use enhanced strict mode settings
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL exclude test files from compilation
3. WHEN type checking THEN the system SHALL enforce exact optional property types
4. WHEN detecting unreachable code THEN the system SHALL flag implicit returns and fallthrough cases
5. WHEN accessing array elements THEN the system SHALL check for undefined values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tracking types, so that I can monitor calculation performance and optimize bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing calculations THEN the system SHALL track execution time metrics
2. WHEN using memory THEN the system SHALL monitor memory usage during calculations
3. WHEN accessing cached data THEN the system SHALL track cache hit rates
4. WHEN optimizing calculations THEN the system SHALL provide performance metadata
5. WHEN debugging performance THEN the system SHALL include cache keys for identification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced testing types and fixtures, so that I can write more comprehensive and maintainable tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide structured test fixture types
2. WHEN defining expected outputs THEN the system SHALL support partial result matching
3. WHEN comparing financial calculations THEN the system SHALL allow configurable tolerance levels
4. WHEN testing temporal calculations THEN the system SHALL provide time-based tolerance settings
5. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive scenario naming

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want input sanitization types, so that I can ensure all user inputs are properly validated and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user inputs THEN the system SHALL mark sanitized inputs with branded types
2. WHEN validating Bitcoin addresses THEN the system SHALL use address validation functions
3. WHEN sanitization fails THEN the system SHALL throw ValidationError with descriptive messages
4. WHEN inputs are sanitized THEN the system SHALL preserve type information through the pipeline
5. WHEN handling form data THEN the system SHALL sanitize all string inputs before processing
