# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical color consistency and accessibility issues in the Bitcoin Benefit application. The current implementation uses inconsistent orange/amber colors, has poor contrast in dark theme areas, doesn't align with Bitcoin industry standards, and fails to meet accessibility contrast requirements. This standardization will improve user experience, brand consistency, and ensure WCAG compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want sufficient color contrast throughout the application, so that I can easily read all text and interface elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any text on white backgrounds THEN the text color SHALL have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (WCAG AA standard)
2. WHEN viewing light gray text (#9ca3af) on white backgrounds THEN the text color SHALL be updated to minimum #6b7280 for improved contrast
3. WHEN using the application in dark theme THEN all text SHALL maintain sufficient contrast against dark backgrounds
4. WHEN viewing any interactive elements THEN they SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast requirements in both light and dark themes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Bitcoin user, I want the application to use the industry-standard Bitcoin orange color, so that the branding feels authentic and recognizable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any primary action buttons or CTAs THEN they SHALL use the standardized Bitcoin orange color #f2a900
2. WHEN comparing the application colors to Bitcoin industry standards THEN the orange color SHALL match the recognized Bitcoin brand color #f2a900
3. WHEN viewing the application THEN inconsistent orange/amber colors (#f97316 vs #fbbf24) SHALL be replaced with the standard #f2a900
4. WHEN using any primary interactive elements THEN they SHALL consistently use #f2a900 across the entire application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want a consistent color hierarchy system, so that I can easily apply appropriate colors for different UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing primary actions THEN they SHALL use Bitcoin orange (#f2a900) consistently
2. WHEN implementing secondary actions THEN they SHALL use a designated blue color consistently
3. WHEN viewing the color system documentation THEN it SHALL clearly define the hierarchy: Orange for primary actions, blue for secondary actions
4. WHEN adding new UI components THEN developers SHALL have clear guidelines on which colors to use for different element types
5. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all color usage SHALL follow the established hierarchy without exceptions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want visually consistent styling across all pages and components, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between different pages THEN the color usage SHALL be consistent across all sections
2. WHEN viewing similar UI elements (buttons, links, cards) THEN they SHALL use the same color values throughout the application
3. WHEN comparing components THEN there SHALL be no instances of multiple orange/amber variations being used
4. WHEN using the application THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL be clear and consistent through proper color application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer or developer working on the application, I want centralized color definitions, so that future updates can be made efficiently and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating color values THEN changes SHALL be made in a centralized location (CSS variables, design tokens, or configuration)
2. WHEN adding new colors THEN they SHALL be defined in the centralized color system
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN hardcoded color values SHALL be replaced with centralized references
4. WHEN maintaining the application THEN color changes SHALL propagate automatically throughout all components that reference the centralized values
