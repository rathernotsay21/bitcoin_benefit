# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Fix duplicate imports in on-chain modules
  - Remove duplicate RawTransaction imports from concurrentProcessing.ts, mempool-api.ts, and price-fetcher.ts
  - Consolidate imports to single import statements per module
  - Verify TypeScript compilation after changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Clean up debug console statements in production code
  - Remove console.log statements from production code paths in hooks and services
  - Replace with proper logging where necessary or remove entirely
  - Preserve development-only console statements that are properly guarded
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Fix empty catch blocks and improve error handling
  - Replace empty catch blocks in secureCacheManager.ts with proper error handling
  - Improve catch blocks in timestampService.ts that only have fallback logic
  - Ensure all catch blocks have meaningful error handling or logging
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Remove unused variables and clean up dead code
  - Remove unused variables identified in secure-fetch-wrapper.ts and other files
  - Clean up unused imports that are no longer referenced
  - Verify removal doesn't break any dependent code
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Address technical debt markers (TODO/FIXME comments)
  - Review and remove TODO comments for production integrations that are placeholders
  - Clean up FIXME markers in test validation scripts where issues are resolved
  - Remove debug-related TODOs that are no longer needed
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Fix broken import references and missing files
  - Fix the mock import in useCallback.test.tsx to reference the correct component path
  - Update `@/components/VestingTimelineChart` to `@/components/VestingTimelineChartRecharts`
  - Verify all import paths resolve correctly
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 7. Consolidate duplicate function definitions and exports
  - Review and consolidate any duplicate function definitions found in the codebase
  - Ensure no naming conflicts exist between modules
  - Verify all functionality is preserved during consolidation
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 8. Validate and test all changes
  - Run TypeScript compilation to ensure no syntax errors
  - Execute test suite to verify no functionality is broken
  - Perform manual verification of critical code paths
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 5.3, 6.3_
