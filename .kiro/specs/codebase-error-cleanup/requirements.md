# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive cleanup of duplicate, malformed, and obviously wrong code throughout the codebase. The goal is to identify and remove code that is completely in error, including duplicate imports, unused variables, malformed functions, excessive debug logging, and other code quality issues that negatively impact maintainability and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate imports removed from all files, so that the codebase is cleaner and build times are faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate import statements
2. WHEN duplicate imports are found THEN the system SHALL remove the redundant imports while preserving functionality
3. WHEN imports are consolidated THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes occur to the code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excessive console logging removed from production code, so that the application performs better and logs are cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning source files THEN the system SHALL identify console.log, console.debug, and other debug statements
2. WHEN debug statements are found in production code THEN the system SHALL remove or replace them with proper logging
3. WHEN console statements are development-only THEN the system SHALL preserve them if they're properly guarded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables and imports removed, so that the codebase is cleaner and bundle sizes are smaller.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL identify unused variables, constants, and imports
2. WHEN unused code is found THEN the system SHALL remove it safely without breaking functionality
3. WHEN removing unused code THEN the system SHALL verify no other files depend on the removed code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want malformed or incomplete code structures fixed, so that the codebase follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning code THEN the system SHALL identify empty catch blocks, incomplete functions, and malformed interfaces
2. WHEN malformed code is found THEN the system SHALL fix or remove it appropriately
3. WHEN fixing code structures THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TODO/FIXME comments reviewed and addressed, so that technical debt is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning code THEN the system SHALL identify all TODO, FIXME, XXX, HACK, and BUG comments
2. WHEN technical debt markers are found THEN the system SHALL evaluate if they can be resolved or removed
3. WHEN removing markers THEN the system SHALL ensure the underlying issue is actually addressed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate function definitions and exports removed, so that there are no naming conflicts or confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning modules THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate function definitions and exports
2. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into single, correct implementations
3. WHEN consolidating functions THEN the system SHALL preserve all necessary functionality from both versions
