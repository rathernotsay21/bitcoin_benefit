# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Bitcoin Benefits project has undergone significant React and content changes over the past 24 hours, resulting in widespread test failures that are primarily infrastructure-related rather than functional code issues. Recent commits include "Chart improvement", "track page broke", "icons and nav bar", and "React Plan finished", indicating substantial UI and component restructuring.

Current test failures include unicode escape errors in test files, Jest/Vitest configuration conflicts causing "Vitest cannot be imported in a CommonJS module" errors, and outdated import paths where tests reference `@/app/on-chain/page` but the actual component is at `@/app/track/page.tsx`. The test suite shows critical syntax errors preventing any tests from running.

The goal is to systematically repair and modernize the test infrastructure to ensure reliable, maintainable testing that supports the development workflow without blocking deployments or reducing developer confidence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified and properly configured test environment, so that I can run tests without configuration conflicts and module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running any test file THEN the system SHALL use a consistent module resolution strategy without CommonJS/ES module conflicts
2. WHEN importing Vitest or Jest utilities THEN the system SHALL properly resolve imports without "cannot be imported in CommonJS" errors
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use a single, well-configured test runner (either Jest or Vitest, not both conflicting)
4. IF performance tests are run THEN the system SHALL use Vitest with proper ES module support
5. IF component tests are run THEN the system SHALL use the same test runner with consistent configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to parse and execute without syntax errors, so that I can focus on test logic rather than configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files contain multiline template strings THEN the system SHALL parse them without unicode escape errors
2. WHEN test files use string literals with special characters THEN the SWC transformer SHALL process them correctly
3. WHEN tests include Bitcoin symbols (â‚¿) or other unicode characters THEN the system SHALL handle them properly in assertions
4. IF string formatting issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests to accurately reflect the current React implementation, so that tests validate actual functionality rather than outdated expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Bitcoin amount formatting THEN the system SHALL expect the correct format that matches the actual component output
2. WHEN testing chart components THEN the system SHALL find elements using the correct test IDs and selectors that exist in the current implementation
3. WHEN testing component interactions THEN the system SHALL use assertions that match the current component behavior
4. IF component structure has changed THEN the system SHALL update test expectations to match the new structure
5. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL properly mock and test viewport changes
6. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL use correct import paths that match the current file structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to run reliably and provide meaningful metrics, so that I can validate optimization effectiveness and catch performance regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL execute without module import errors
2. WHEN measuring performance metrics THEN the system SHALL provide consistent and accurate measurements
3. WHEN testing concurrent processing THEN the system SHALL properly validate optimization effectiveness
4. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which optimizations need attention
5. WHEN running benchmark tests THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality, so that I can ensure the complete user experience works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL execute without syntax or parsing errors
2. WHEN testing error handling flows THEN the system SHALL properly validate error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN testing data flow between components THEN the system SHALL validate the complete interaction chain
4. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about which part of the integration is broken

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test infrastructure to support the development workflow, so that I can confidently make changes and deploy without fear of breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL provide confidence that the application functionality is working correctly
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether the failure is due to infrastructure issues or actual code problems
3. WHEN running the full test suite THEN the system SHALL complete in a reasonable time (under 5 minutes for the full suite)
4. IF CI/CD pipelines depend on test results THEN the system SHALL provide reliable pass/fail indicators
5. WHEN developers run tests locally THEN the system SHALL provide the same results as the CI environment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage documentation and standards, so that I can write effective tests and maintain the test suite over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear patterns and examples to follow
2. WHEN test infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL include updated documentation
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for running and writing tests
4. IF test patterns need to be updated THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and examples
5. WHEN reviewing test coverage THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful metrics about what is and isn't tested
