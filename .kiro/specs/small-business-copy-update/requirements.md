# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on updating and improving the copy on the Bitcoin Benefit platform's landing page and "learn more" page to better target small business owners. The current content is too technical and crypto-focused, making it less accessible to practical business owners who run companies like pottery studios, auto-mechanic shops, and construction companies. The goal is to reframe the Bitcoin vesting benefits in terms that resonate with small business challenges and priorities, emphasizing practical business outcomes over technical Bitcoin details.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a small business owner, I want to understand how Bitcoin vesting can solve my employee retention problems, so that I can make an informed decision about implementing this benefit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a small business owner visits the landing page THEN the hero section SHALL emphasize employee retention and loyalty over Bitcoin technical details
2. WHEN a small business owner reads the main value proposition THEN the system SHALL present benefits in terms of business outcomes (reduced turnover, increased loyalty, competitive advantage)
3. WHEN a small business owner views the feature descriptions THEN the system SHALL use language that relates to their daily business challenges
4. IF a small business owner is unfamiliar with Bitcoin THEN the system SHALL present the concept as a modern employee benefit rather than a cryptocurrency investment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a small business owner with limited time, I want to quickly understand the practical benefits and costs, so that I can evaluate if this fits my business needs and budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a small business owner views the vesting schemes THEN the system SHALL present them as employee benefit packages rather than Bitcoin investment strategies
2. WHEN a small business owner reads scheme descriptions THEN the system SHALL emphasize business outcomes (retention periods, employee satisfaction) over technical Bitcoin details
3. WHEN a small business owner views cost information THEN the system SHALL present it in terms of business investment and ROI rather than Bitcoin amounts
4. WHEN a small business owner evaluates the options THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on which approach fits different business sizes and situations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a small business owner concerned about employee turnover, I want to see evidence that this approach works, so that I can justify the investment to myself and potential stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a small business owner views the benefits section THEN the system SHALL include specific retention statistics and business outcomes
2. WHEN a small business owner reads success stories or examples THEN the system SHALL reference relatable small business scenarios
3. WHEN a small business owner views historical performance THEN the system SHALL frame it as employee benefit value rather than investment returns
4. WHEN a small business owner considers implementation THEN the system SHALL address common small business concerns (complexity, cost, employee understanding)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a small business owner who values transparency and simplicity, I want to understand how this benefit works for my employees, so that I can explain it confidently to my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a small business owner reads about employee experience THEN the system SHALL explain the benefit in simple, non-technical terms
2. WHEN a small business owner views the transparency features THEN the system SHALL emphasize trust-building and employee empowerment aspects
3. WHEN a small business owner considers employee education THEN the system SHALL present Bitcoin learning as financial literacy rather than cryptocurrency speculation

### Requirement 5
