# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Bitcoin Tools for Everyone is a standalone page that provides simplified, user-friendly Bitcoin blockchain tools. The goal is to create a "Mempool.space for dummies" experience that makes complex on-chain data digestible and useful for regular people, without requiring technical Bitcoin knowledge. This page will complement the existing vesting tracker but operate independently, allowing users to discover and use Bitcoin tools without any connection to vesting or financial tracking.
