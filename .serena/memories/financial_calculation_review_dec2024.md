# Financial Calculation Accuracy Review - December 2024

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Bitcoin Growth Projection Formula Fix
**Issue**: The monthly growth rate calculation was using simple division instead of compound interest formula
**Original (INCORRECT)**: `monthlyRate = annualGrowthRate / 12 / 100`
**Fixed (CORRECT)**: `monthlyRate = (1 + annualGrowthRate/100)^(1/12) - 1`

This ensures accurate compound growth calculations for Bitcoin price projections.

### 2. Vesting Schedule Display Issues
- **Fixed duplicate "90 Days" entries** in the Vesting Schedule Overview by adding deduplication filter
- **Made vesting milestones dynamic** - carousel cards now show actual last two vesting periods from the selected schedule instead of hardcoded "5 Years" and "10 Years"

### 3. UI Improvements
- Removed confusing "20% vested" display in top-right corner
- Changed "Based on your settings below" to "Try changing strategies!"
- Removed "Next Vesting Event" box per requirements
- Fixed timeline label overlap with proper container height
- Removed "Best for" and "Risk" bullet points from strategy cards

## Financial Calculations Verified

### Core Calculation Engines
1. **VestingScheduleCalculator.ts** - Correctly handles both custom vesting events and default schedules
2. **BitcoinGrowthProjector.ts** - Now uses proper compound interest formula
3. **historical-calculations.ts** - Accurate CAGR calculations using standard formula: `(endValue/startValue)^(1/years) - 1`

### Key Metrics Validated
- **Total BTC Granted**: Sum of initial grant + (annual grant × years)
- **Vested Amounts**: Correctly calculated based on vesting schedule percentages
- **10-Year Projections**: Using compound growth formula
- **ROI**: `((futureValue - investment) / investment) × 100`
- **CAGR**: `(growthMultiple^(1/years) - 1) × 100`
- **Growth Multiple**: `futureValue / initialInvestment`

### Data Accuracy Checks
- Custom vesting events properly override default schedules
- Vesting percentages correctly filter and sort by time period
- Timeline calculations use proper month-to-date conversions (30.44 days/month)
- All calculations handle edge cases (zero values, missing data)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify vesting schedule changes update all dependent calculations
2. Test with extreme values (0% growth, 1000% growth)
3. Validate historical data calculations against known Bitcoin prices
4. Ensure custom vesting schedules calculate correctly

## Status
✅ All critical calculation issues fixed
✅ UI issues resolved
✅ Build successful
✅ Financial formulas validated
