Successfully implemented a comprehensive test validation and health check system that addresses all requirements from the test infrastructure repair specification.

## 📋 DELIVERED COMPONENTS

### 1. Test File Validator (`test-file-validator.ts`)
- ✅ **Syntax validation** - Detects TypeScript compilation errors and malformed strings
- ✅ **Import path validation** - Identifies outdated component imports (`@/app/on-chain/page` → `@/app/track/page`)
- ✅ **String formatting validation** - Fixes unicode escape errors and escaped newlines
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Detects Jest/Vitest conflicts and missing test content
- ✅ **Best practices validation** - Enforces testing standards and mocking patterns

### 2. Test Health Monitor (`test-health-monitor.ts`)
- ✅ **Reliability tracking** - Success rates, flaky test detection, consistently failing tests
- ✅ **Performance monitoring** - Runtime trends, slow test identification, optimization opportunities  
- ✅ **Coverage analysis** - Coverage percentages, trends, critical path analysis
- ✅ **Historical data** - Stores test run history with environment context
- ✅ **Health scoring** - 0-100 health score with categorized recommendations

### 3. Pre-commit Hook System (`pre-commit-setup.ts`)
- ✅ **Automated validation** - Syntax, imports, formatting checks before commits
- ✅ **Configurable rules** - Customizable validation levels and timeouts
- ✅ **Git integration** - Seamless pre-commit hook installation and management
- ✅ **Error prevention** - Blocks commits with malformed test files
- ✅ **Developer guidance** - Clear error messages and fix suggestions

### 4. Health Dashboard (`dashboard.ts`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive reporting** - Combines all validation and health metrics
- ✅ **Status categorization** - Healthy/Warning/Critical status levels
- ✅ **Prioritized recommendations** - High/Medium/Low priority actionable items
- ✅ **Infrastructure monitoring** - Tracks test runner configuration and tooling setup
- ✅ **Maintenance mode** - Automated infrastructure maintenance and repair

### 5. Supporting Infrastructure
- ✅ **Self-test system** (`self-test.ts`) - Validates the validation system itself
- ✅ **Fix automation** (`fix-test-issues.js`) - Automated common issue resolution
- ✅ **NPM scripts integration** - 11 new test management commands
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (`README.md`) - Complete usage guide and troubleshooting

npm run test:hooks:status  # Check hook status
```

## 📊 VALIDATION CAPABILITIES

### Test File Issues Detected:
- ❌ TypeScript syntax errors and compilation issues
- ❌ Malformed unicode escape sequences (`\u123g`)
- ❌ Escaped newlines that should be actual newlines (`\\n`)
- ❌ Outdated import paths (`@/app/on-chain/page`)
- ❌ Jest/Vitest configuration conflicts
- ❌ Missing test content or empty test files
- ⚠️ Inconsistent mocking patterns
- ⚠️ Poor test descriptions and practices

### Health Metrics Tracked:
- 📈 **Success Rate**: Percentage of passing test runs
- 🔄 **Flaky Tests**: Tests with inconsistent pass/fail results
- ⏱️ **Performance**: Runtime trends and slow test identification
- 📊 **Coverage**: Percentage trends and critical path analysis
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure**: Hook installation and runner configuration

## 🏥 HEALTH SCORING SYSTEM

### Status Levels:
- **💚 Healthy (80-100)**: All systems operational, high reliability
- **💛 Warning (50-79)**: Some issues present, functional but needs attention  
- **❤️ Critical (0-49)**: Serious issues requiring immediate intervention

### Scoring Factors:
- **Test Reliability** (40% weight): Success rates and consistency
- **Performance** (30% weight): Runtime trends and optimization
- **Coverage** (30% weight): Code coverage percentages and trends

## 🔧 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

### Seamless Integration:
✅ **Vitest Configuration**: Uses existing `vitest.config.ts` setup
✅ **TypeScript**: Validates against project `tsconfig.json`
✅ **Coverage**: Leverages existing coverage configuration
