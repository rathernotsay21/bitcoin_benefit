## Dev Team Prompts

### nextjs-developer agent prompt
Using the nextjs-developer agent, please review the structure of my Next.js 14 application within the src/app directory. Focus on best practices for the App Router, data fetching patterns for the CoinGecko API, and any potential performance optimizations for static site generation, especially concerning the calculator/ and historical/ pages.

### react-specialist agent prompt
Invoke the react-specialist agent. I need a review of my state management approach using Zustand. Analyze src/stores/calculatorStore.ts and src/stores/historicalCalculatorStore.ts and suggest how to improve efficiency for real-time calculations. Also, please critique my component architecture in src/components/ for adherence to modern React best practices.

### typescript-pro agent prompt
I need the typescript-pro agent to perform a deep review of my TypeScript implementation. Please focus on the src/types/vesting.ts file and how those types are used within the calculation engines (src/lib/vesting-calculations.ts and src/lib/historical-calculations.ts). Suggest improvements for stricter type safety, clarity, and maintainability.

### frontend-developer agent prompt
Engage the frontend-developer agent. Please review the UI/UX of my application, focusing on the implementation of Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Specifically, analyze the interactive charts in the historical/ calculator that use Recharts and suggest improvements for better visual feedback, accessibility, and overall user experience.
