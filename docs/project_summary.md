# Bitcoin Vesting Calculator - Project Summary

## 1. Project Overview
A comprehensive web application for employers to plan and visualize Bitcoin vesting schemes for their employees. The calculator offers multiple vesting strategies designed to incentivize employee retention while introducing them to Bitcoin as a store of value. The application features two main calculators: a "Future Calculator" for projecting potential outcomes and a "Historical Calculator" for analyzing past performance.

## 2. ðŸŽ¯ Current Implementation Status

#### **Core Application Infrastructure**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router, deployed on Netlify.
- **Language**: TypeScript, with strict type checking.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a professional and responsive design.
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient, centralized state management.
- **Data Fetching**: Integration with CoinGecko API for live and historical Bitcoin prices, with caching and fallback mechanisms.
- **Performance**: Heavily optimized with code splitting, static data generation, and optimized components.

#### **Calculators & Features**
- **Future Calculator**:
  - Three pre-configured vesting schemes with customizable grant amounts.
  - Real-time calculations and interactive charts (Recharts).
  - URL deep linking for sharing specific plan configurations.
- **Historical Calculator**:
  - Analyzes scheme performance using historical data from 2015.
  - Supports multiple cost basis methods (Average, High, Low).
  - Detailed annual breakdown and performance metrics (Total Return, Annualized Return).
- **Vesting Schemes**:
  - **Pioneer (`accelerator`)**: Aggressive plan with a large upfront grant.
  - **Stacker (`steady-builder`)**: Balanced approach with an initial grant and annual bonuses.
  - **Builder (`slow-burn`)**: Conservative, long-term plan with annual grants over a decade.

## 3. ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### **Architecture**
The project follows a modern frontend architecture, leveraging the Next.js App Router for server-side rendering and static site generation where appropriate.

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript definitions
â””â”€â”€ next.config.js          # Next.js configuration with webpack optimizations
```

#### **State Management & Data Flow**
- **Zustand Stores**: `calculatorStore.ts` and `historicalCalculatorStore.ts` manage the state for their respective calculators. They handle user inputs, API data, and calculation results.
- **Data Fetching**: The `BitcoinAPI` and `HistoricalBitcoinAPI` classes in `src/lib/` are responsible for fetching data from CoinGecko. They include caching to minimize API calls.
- **Component Interaction**: Components dispatch actions to the Zustand stores. The stores then update their state, and the components re-render with the new data. Calculations are often debounced to prevent excessive processing while the user is typing.

#### **Performance & Optimization**
The application is designed for high performance:
- **Static Data**: `scripts/generate-static-data.js` and `scripts/update-bitcoin-data.js` are used to create static JSON files for historical prices and pre-calculated results. This reduces client-side processing and API calls.
- **Code Splitting**: The `next.config.js` file contains extensive webpack optimizations to split code into logical chunks (e.g., for Recharts, UI libraries), which are loaded on demand.
- **Optimized Components**: Components like `HistoricalTimelineVisualizationOptimized` are used to ensure smooth rendering of charts and data.
- **Lazy Loading**: `next/dynamic` is used to lazy-load components that are not needed for the initial render.
