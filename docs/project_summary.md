# Bitcoin Vesting Calculator - Project Summary

## Project Overview
A comprehensive web application for employers to plan and visualize Bitcoin vesting schemes for their employees. The calculator offers multiple vesting strategies designed to incentivize employee retention while introducing them to Bitcoin as a store of value. The application features two main calculators: a "Future Calculator" for projecting potential outcomes and a "Historical Calculator" for analyzing past performance.

  - **Pioneer**: An aggressive plan with a large upfront grant.
  - **Stacker**: A balanced approach with an initial grant and annual bonuses.
  - **Builder**: A long-term plan with annual grants over a decade.
- **Custom Plan Creator**: Users can create completely custom vesting schemes
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant updates as parameters change
- **Interactive Plan Selection**: Visual feedback, radio button controls
- **URL Deep Linking**: Direct links to calculator with specific plans pre-selected

#### **Historical Calculator Functionality**
- **Historical Price Data**: Fetches real Bitcoin prices from 2015 to present.
- **Cost Basis Methods**: Three calculation methods - Average, High, Low yearly prices.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Recharts-based timeline showing BTC balance and USD value over time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Total return, annualized return, and growth multiples.
- **Annual Breakdown**: Detailed table showing grants, costs, and values by year.

#### **Live Data Integration**
- **Real-time Bitcoin Prices**: Current USD price with 24-hour change percentage
- **API Caching**: 5-minute cache to prevent excessive API calls
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if API fails
- **Loading States**: Professional UX during data fetching

#### **Calculation Engine**
- **Advanced Vesting Mathematics**: Complete timeline calculations with compound growth
- **Multiple Parameter Support**:
  - Employee annual â‚¿ contributions
  - Number of employees
  - Projected Bitcoin growth rates
  - Custom vesting schedules
  - Employer matching percentages
  - Initial grant amounts
  - Bonus structures
- **Financial Projections**: USD and â‚¿ values over full vesting periods
- **Summary Analytics**: Total costs, Bitcoin requirements, vesting periods

#### **User Experience**
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, professional design with clear information hierarchy
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant calculation updates as inputs change
- **Comprehensive Scheme Details**: Full breakdown of vesting schedules and bonuses
- **Results Display**: Multiple views of calculated data (summary cards, detailed breakdowns)
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualizations powered by Recharts.

#### **State Management Flow**
1. User selects vesting scheme â†’ Zustand store updates
2. Bitcoin price fetched â†’ Store updated with live data  
3. User modifies parameters â†’ Debounced calculation trigger
4. Calculation engine processes â†’ Results stored and displayed
5. Real-time UI updates â†’ Professional user experience

#### **API Integration**
- **CoinGecko Integration**: Reliable cryptocurrency price data
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute cache prevents rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to default prices if API unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for API responses
