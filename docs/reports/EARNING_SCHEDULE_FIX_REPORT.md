# Earning Schedule Fix Report

## Date: 2025-08-22

## Summary
Successfully fixed the core vesting calculation logic to ensure grant distributions respect Earning Schedule selections (Recruit, Retain, Reward). Also resolved a production build error related to undefined customVestingEvents variable.

## Problem Statement
When users selected different Earning Schedules (Recruit, Retain, Reward), the grant distribution was not being limited appropriately:
- **Recruit (2 years)**: Grants continued beyond year 2
- **Retain (5 years)**: Grants continued beyond year 5  
- **Reward (10 years)**: Was working correctly by coincidence

This led to incorrect financial projections and misleading cost calculations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core Calculation Engine Fixes

#### VestingScheduleCalculator.ts
- **Fixed `getGrantRule()` method**: Now checks for custom vesting events first and uses the last event's time period as the grant limit
- **Result**: Grant distribution now stops at the correct time based on earning schedule

#### vesting-calculations.ts
- **Fixed `calculateTotalContributions()` method**: Now respects custom vesting events when calculating total contributions
- **Result**: Total cost calculations are now accurate for each earning schedule

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### VestingTimelineChartRecharts.tsx
- **Fixed `grantRules` calculation**: Now uses custom vesting events to determine when grants stop
- **Fixed `costBasis` calculation**: Now correctly calculates total employer cost based on earning schedule
- **Result**: Charts accurately display grant distribution timeline

#### MetricCards.tsx
- **Fixed `totalBTCGranted` calculation**: Now respects custom vesting events for grant limits
- **Fixed production build error**: Resolved undefined `customVestingEvents` variable by properly extracting from `displayScheme`
- **Result**: Metric cards show accurate totals based on selected earning schedule and no production build errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Recruit Schedule (2 years)
- Grants stop after year 2
- Vesting continues to 100% at year 2
- Total cost reflects only 2 years of grants

### Retain Schedule (5 years)
- Grants stop after year 5
- Vesting continues gradually to 100% at year 5
- Total cost reflects only 5 years of grants

### Reward Schedule (10 years)
- Grants continue through year 10
- Vesting reaches 100% at year 10
- Total cost reflects full 10 years of grants

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/calculators/VestingScheduleCalculator.ts`
2. `/src/lib/vesting-calculations.ts`
3. `/src/components/VestingTimelineChartRecharts.tsx`
4. `/src/components/MetricCards.tsx`

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ Lint check passed with no warnings
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Visual verification of grant limits for each earning schedule
- ✅ Production build completes without errors
- ✅ Fixed undefined variable error in MetricCards component

## Impact
This fix ensures:
- **Financial Accuracy**: Employers see the correct total cost for their chosen earning schedule
- **Clear Communication**: Grant distribution timeline matches the selected earning schedule
- **Trust**: The tool now provides reliable calculations for financial planning

## Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- The UI remains simple and clean without unnecessary complexity
- Custom vesting events now properly control grant distribution throughout the application
- Production build error was caused by referencing undefined variable in MetricCards.tsx (line 129)
- Fix involved properly extracting customVestingEvents from displayScheme object before use
