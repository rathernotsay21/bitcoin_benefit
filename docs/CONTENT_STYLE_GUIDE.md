## Voice & Tone Philosophy

### Core Voice Attributes
Our voice is defined by three guiding Yogi Berra quotes that appear throughout the site:
- **"The future ain't what it used to be"** - Acknowledges uncertainty while embracing change
- **"When you come to a fork in the road, take it"** - Decisive action despite ambiguity
- **"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is."** - Grounded pragmatism over abstract promises

### Voice Characteristics
- **Straight-talking**: Like explaining to a smart neighbor, not a boardroom
- **Paradoxically wise**: Comfortable with complexity, expressed simply
- **Respectfully irreverent**: Professional without corporate stuffiness
- **Confidently uncertain**: Honest about what we know and don't know

### Tone Variations by Context

#### Hero/Landing Pages
- Bold and decisive
- Slightly provocative (challenging status quo)
- Energy without hype

#### Educational Content
- Patient and clear
- Assuming intelligence, not knowledge
- Building confidence through understanding

#### Tools & Calculators
- Matter-of-fact and functional
- Focus on utility over persuasion
- Numbers speak louder than adjectives

#### Error States
- Human and helpful
- Taking responsibility without blame
- Solution-focused

## Writing Principles

### 1. Concrete Over Abstract
❌ **Don't write:** "Maximize employee retention through innovative compensation strategies"
✅ **Do write:** "Keep your best people with bitcoin benefits"

### 2. Admit Trade-offs
❌ **Don't write:** "The perfect solution for every business"
✅ **Do write:** "It's not perfect, but it's better than watching benefits lose value"

### 3. Show, Don't Sell
❌ **Don't write:** "Revolutionary blockchain technology transforms benefits"
✅ **Do write:** "Bitcoin's been around since 2009. Still here."

### 4. One Idea Per Sentence
❌ **Don't write:** "Our comprehensive platform enables businesses to implement bitcoin benefits while managing vesting schedules and tracking performance metrics."
✅ **Do write:** "Set up bitcoin benefits. Track the results. That's it."

### 5. Respect Reader's Time
- Lead with the point
- Details follow necessity
- Every word earns its place

## Grammar & Mechanics

### Capitalization
- **Bitcoin**: Capitalize when referring to the network/protocol
- **bitcoin**: Lowercase when referring to the currency/units
- **Company names**: As they style themselves (River Financial, Cash App)
- **Feature names**: Title case (Pioneer Plan, Bitcoin Tools)
- **UI elements**: Sentence case for buttons and links

### Punctuation
- **Contractions**: Use liberally (it's, you'll, won't, doesn't)
- **Oxford comma**: Always use for clarity
- **Exclamation points**: Maximum one per page, preferably zero
- **Ellipsis**: Avoid except in loading states

### Numbers & Data
- Spell out one through nine in body text
- Use numerals for 10+, percentages, and technical specs
- Bitcoin amounts: "0.02 BTC" not "0.02 bitcoin"
- Years of experience: "16 years" not "sixteen years"
- Money: "$100" not "one hundred dollars"

### Sentence Structure
- Average 15-20 words per sentence
- Vary length for rhythm
- Start with strong verbs when possible
- End with impact

---

## Naming Conventions

### Product Names
- **Plans**: Pioneer, Stacker, Builder (not "Pioneer Plan" in body text)
- **Tools**: Descriptive function names (Transaction Tracker, Fee Calculator)
- **Features**: What they do, not what they are

### File & Code References
- Never expose technical implementation to users
- Translate technical terms to human language
- Focus on benefit, not mechanism

### Navigation & Menu Items
- Action-oriented where possible
- Maximum two words preferred
- Consistent across all touchpoints

---

## Page Structure & Headings

### Heading Hierarchy

#### H1 - Page Title
- One per page maximum
- State the page's purpose
- 3-7 words ideal

#### H2 - Major Sections
- Question or statement format
- Scannable and specific
- Parallel construction within page

#### H3 - Subsections
- Supporting details
- Actionable when appropriate
- Maintain voice consistency

### Opening Paragraphs
- Hook with recognition of user's situation

### Body Content
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points for scannable lists
- Bold for emphasis, not italics
- White space as design element

## UI Copy Guidelines

### Buttons & CTAs

#### Primary Actions
- **Exploring**: "See the Numbers" (not "Calculate")
- **Learning**: "Check It Out" (not "Learn More")
- **Trying**: "Try It" (not "Get Started")
- **Committing**: "Start Now" (not "Sign Up")

#### Secondary Actions

## Error Messages & Feedback

### Error Message Formula
1. What happened (briefly)
2. Why (if not obvious)
3. What to do next

### Examples

#### Network Errors
❌ **Don't:** "Error: Failed to fetch data from endpoint"
✅ **Do:** "Can't reach the blockchain right now. Try again?"

#### Invalid Input
❌ **Don't:** "Invalid format detected in input field"
✅ **Do:** "That doesn't look right. Bitcoin addresses start with 1, 3, or bc1"

#### System Errors
❌ **Don't:** "An unexpected error has occurred"
✅ **Do:** "Something broke. Try again?"

### Success Messages
- Confirm what happened
- Skip the celebration
- Suggest next step if relevant

## Bitcoin-Specific Terminology

### Always Explain First Use
- **Blockchain**: The public ledger
- **Wallet**: Where you store bitcoin
- **Transaction**: Moving bitcoin between wallets
- **Fees**: Cost to use the network
- **Confirmation**: Network validation

### Avoid or Translate

- ❌ "Sats" → ✅ "bitcoin" (unless in tools)
- ❌ "Moon" → ✅ "increase in value"
- ❌ "DCA" → ✅ "regular buying"
- ❌ "Cold storage" → ✅ "offline storage"

### Technical Accuracy
- Maintain accuracy without jargon
- Link to detailed explanations
- Progressive disclosure for complexity

## Call-to-Action Standards

### Hierarchy of Commitment
1. **Explore** - No commitment ("See how it works")
2. **Try** - Low commitment ("Run the numbers")
3. **Start** - Medium commitment ("Set it up")
4. **Commit** - High commitment ("Start today")

### CTA Principles

- Specify the outcome
- Match user's readiness
- One primary CTA per section

- Provide context for numbers
- Use familiar comparisons

### Inclusive Language
- "Your team" not "your employees"
- "People" not "users"
