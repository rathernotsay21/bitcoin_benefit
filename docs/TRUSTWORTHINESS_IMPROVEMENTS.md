### 2. Site Rebranding & Positioning
- **Manifest.json** - Rebranded from "Bitcoin Benefit Calculator" to "Employee Benefits Platform"
- **Business Categories** - Added professional categorization: `["business", "finance", "productivity"]`
- **Description Focus** - Shifted emphasis from cryptocurrency to HR technology and employee retention

## üéØ Why Sites Get Blocked

### Common Triggers for Network Filters
1. **Cryptocurrency Keywords** - Many networks auto-block crypto-related content
2. **Missing Trust Signals** - No sitemap, security.txt, or proper metadata
3. **Suspicious Headers** - Hidden X-Powered-By, aggressive CSP policies
4. **Lack of Business Classification** - No clear category or purpose
5. **Missing Legal Pages** - No visible privacy policy or terms of service

## üìã Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Domain & DNS Configuration (High Priority)
```bash
# Add these DNS records to your domain provider
TXT  @  "v=spf1 include:_spf.netlify.app ~all"
TXT  _dmarc  "v=DMARC1; p=none; rsp=security@yourdomain.com"
```

### 2. Search Engine Registration (High Priority)
- [ ] Register with [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [ ] Submit sitemap.xml through Search Console
- [ ] Register with [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)
- [ ] Add verification meta tags to layout.tsx

### 3. Create Missing Assets (Medium Priority)
```bash
# Create screenshot directory and add placeholder images
mkdir -p public/screenshots
# Add dashboard.png (1920x1080)
# Add calculator.png (1920x1080)
```

### 4. Content Security Policy Improvement (Medium Priority)
Replace unsafe-inline with nonces or hashes:
```javascript
// Generate nonce for each request
const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64');
// Update CSP header
"script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}'"
```

### 5. Add Business Verification Files (Low Priority)
Create these files in `/public/.well-known/`:
- `apple-app-site-association` - For iOS app association
- `assetlinks.json` - For Android app verification
- `microsoft-identity-association.json` - For Microsoft services

## üîç Testing Your Improvements

### 1. Check Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://bitcoinbenefit.netlify.app | grep -E "X-Business-Category|X-Service-Type|X-Powered-By"
```

### 2. Verify Sitemap Accessibility
```bash
curl https://bitcoinbenefit.netlify.app/sitemap.xml
```

### 3. Test Security.txt
```bash
curl https://bitcoinbenefit.netlify.app/.well-known/security.txt
```

### 4. Use Online Tools
- [Security Headers Scanner](https://securityheaders.com/)
- [SSL Labs Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
- [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Trustworthiness Measures

- SSL Certificate seal from your CA
- Privacy certification badges (TrustArc, TRUSTe)
- Security audit badges (SOC 2, ISO 27001)

### 2. Content Adjustments
- Add "Enterprise", "Business", or "Corporate" to key landing pages
- Include case studies from non-crypto companies
- Add testimonials from HR professionals
- Create an "About Us" page with company information

### 3. API Endpoint Renaming
Consider renaming crypto-specific endpoints:
- `/api/bitcoin-price` ‚Üí `/api/asset-price`
- `/api/mempool/*` ‚Üí `/api/network/*`
- `/bitcoin-tools` ‚Üí `/financial-calculators`

### 4. Alternative Domain Strategy
If blocking persists, consider:
- Register a more corporate domain (e.g., `employeebenefitsplatform.com`)
- Use subdomain strategy (e.g., `benefits.yourcompany.com`)
- Mirror site on multiple domains with different branding
