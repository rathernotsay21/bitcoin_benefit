# useCallback Optimization Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented `useCallback` hooks for all event handlers passed to child components across the codebase to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/calculator/[plan]/CalculatorPlanClient.tsx`
- ✅ Wrapped `handleSchemeSelect` with useCallback
- ✅ Wrapped `initialGrant` onChange handler with useCallback
- ✅ Wrapped `annualGrant` onChange handler with useCallback  
- ✅ Wrapped `projectedBitcoinGrowth` onChange handler with useCallback

### 2. `/src/components/VestingTimelineChartRecharts.tsx`
- ✅ Wrapped `onMouseMove` handler with useCallback
- ✅ Wrapped `onMouseLeave` handler with useCallback

### 3. `/src/components/YearSelector.tsx`
- ✅ Wrapped `handleYearChange` with useCallback

### 4. `/src/components/RiskAnalysisCard.tsx`
- ✅ Wrapped toggle button `onClick` handler with useCallback

### 5. `/src/components/on-chain/VestingTrackerFormOptimized.tsx`
- ✅ Already had all handlers properly wrapped with useCallback

## Additional Files Created

### 1. `/src/components/__tests__/useCallback.test.tsx`
- Comprehensive test suite to verify useCallback optimizations
- Tests handler stability across re-renders
- Tests dependency change behavior
- Performance impact tests with React.memo

### 2. `/src/lib/performance/monitor.tsx`
- Performance monitoring utility
- Tracks render counts and times
- Monitors handler recreations
- Provides optimization score
- Development-only performance overlay component

## Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization
- Event handlers were recreated on every render
- Child components receiving these handlers would re-render unnecessarily
- Increased memory allocation and garbage collection

### After Optimization
- Event handlers maintain stable references between renders
- Memoized child components skip unnecessary re-renders
- Reduced memory churn
- Better performance especially in:
  - Calculator form inputs
  - Chart interactions
  - Component state toggles

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Correct Dependencies**: All useCallback hooks include proper dependency arrays
2. **No Over-optimization**: Only wrapped handlers passed to child components or used in performance-critical scenarios
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All handlers maintain their original behavior
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types preserved throughout

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify optimizations work correctly
- Tests ensure handlers remain stable when props don't change
- Tests verify handlers update when dependencies change
- Performance impact tests demonstrate reduction in child re-renders

## Monitoring
- Added performance monitoring utility for development
- Tracks render counts, times, and handler recreations
- Provides optimization score (0-100)
- Visual overlay for real-time performance monitoring

## Impact
This optimization significantly improves the performance of interactive components, particularly:
- Form inputs that update frequently
- Charts with mouse interactions
- Components with frequent state updates

The optimization is especially beneficial on lower-end devices and mobile browsers where JavaScript performance is more limited.
