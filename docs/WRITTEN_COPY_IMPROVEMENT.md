## HOME PAGE (src/app/page.tsx)

### Hero Section Rewrite

**Current**: 
- "Reward Loyalty with Sound Money"
- "No-nonsense benefits that grow stronger over time."

**NEW HERO COPY**:
```
Headline: "Give Your Team a Benefit That Actually Grows"
Subheadline: "Bitcoin employee benefits that appreciate over time, not depreciate like everything else"

Supporting Text: 
While traditional benefits lose value to inflation every year, bitcoin has grown an average of 200% annually since 2009. It's time to reward your team with money that works as hard as they do.

No crypto expertise needed. No complex setups. Just choose a plan, fund it gradually, and watch your employees build real wealth.
```

### NEW SECTION: Why Bitcoin Benefits Make Sense

**Location**: After hero, before plan cards

```
Title: "Why Forward-Thinking Companies Choose Bitcoin"

Every year, your traditional benefits package costs more and delivers less. Health insurance premiums rise. 401(k) matches barely beat inflation. Stock options are complex and often worthless.

Bitcoin is different.

**Scarce by Design**
Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist. Unlike dollars that can be printed endlessly, bitcoin's fixed supply means it tends to gain value over time, not lose it.

**Proven Over 16 Years**
Since 2009, bitcoin has survived every crisis, crash, and criticism to become a trillion-dollar asset class. Major companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square hold billions in bitcoin.

**Simple to Implement**
No complicated vesting schedules. No lawyers. No administrative nightmares. Buy bitcoin, set a timeline, done. Your employees can track their benefits value in real-time.

**Meaningful to Employees**
Young talent especially values bitcoin. Offering it shows you understand their values and are investing in their long-term future, not just their next paycheck.
```

### Plan Card Descriptions - EXPANDED

**Pioneer Plan (Accelerator)**
```
Title: Pioneer - Maximum Impact Plan

For bold companies ready to lead. Make a significant upfront bitcoin investment that your employees earn over 2-4 years. Like the companies that offered early stock options, you'll attract top talent with outsized potential rewards.

Perfect for: Startups, tech companies, and businesses competing for scarce talent
Initial investment: Higher upfront, lower ongoing costs
Employee impact: Life-changing potential in 5-10 years

Example: $10,000 in bitcoin granted today could be worth $50,000-$100,000 by the time it fully vests, based on historical growth patterns.
```

**Stacker Plan (Steady-Builder)**
```
Title: Stacker - Balanced Growth Plan

The sustainable approach. Combine a meaningful initial grant with annual additions. Like dollar-cost averaging, this spreads your risk while building substantial value over time.

Perfect for: Growing companies with steady cash flow
Initial investment: Moderate upfront, predictable ongoing costs
Employee impact: Significant wealth building over career

Example: $5,000 initial grant plus $2,000 yearly creates a powerful compounding effect, potentially worth $75,000+ after 5 years.
```

**Builder Plan (Slow-Burn)**
```
Title: Builder - Gradual Accumulation Plan

Start small, think big. Make bitcoin benefits affordable with smaller, regular contributions that add up over time. Like climbing a mountain, each step seems small but leads to remarkable heights.

Perfect for: Cash-conscious businesses and traditional companies testing bitcoin
Initial investment: Minimal upfront, very low ongoing costs
Employee impact: Meaningful supplement to retirement

Example: Just $1,000 per year in bitcoin could grow to $25,000+ over a decade, creating real value from modest contributions.
```

### NEW SECTION: How It Works

**Location**: After plan cards

```
Title: "Three Simple Steps to Better Benefits"

1. **Choose Your Plan**
Select the approach that fits your budget and culture. Start conservative or go bold - you can adjust as you learn.

2. **Fund Gradually**
Buy bitcoin weekly or monthly to spread out costs. Services like River.com make recurring purchases automatic and simple.

3. **Employees Earn Over Time**
Your team earns their bitcoin gradually according to your vesting schedule. They can track value in real-time and know exactly what they're building toward.

No blockchain knowledge required. No wallets to manage. Just straightforward value that grows.
```

### Footer CTA Rewrite

**Current**: "Stop Losing Your Best Employees"

**NEW CTA**:
```
Headline: "Your Competitors Are Already Doing This"

Body: Forward-thinking companies are using bitcoin benefits to attract and retain the best talent. Every day you wait is a day your employees' traditional benefits lose value to inflation.

Start small. Start today. Start building real wealth for the people building your business.

### Hero Section Rewrite

**Current**: "Build a Sound Money Plan"

**NEW HERO**:
```
Headline: "See Exactly What Bitcoin Benefits Could Mean for Your Team"
Subheadline: "Play with the numbers. No commitment, no email required."
```

### Educational Sidebar Content

**NEW SIDEBAR SECTIONS**:

```
**Understanding Your Calculator**

This tool shows you potential outcomes based on different bitcoin growth scenarios. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, bitcoin has averaged 200% annual growth since inception.

The numbers you see represent:
- Total Cost: What you'll invest in USD
- Future Value: Potential worth based on growth assumptions
- Vested Amount: How much employees own at different points
- Tax Implications: Rough estimates (consult your accountant)

Remember: Even conservative 20% annual growth far exceeds traditional investment returns.
```

### Input Field Descriptions

**Initial Grant Amount**:
```
The bitcoin you'll purchase upfront for each employee. This is their base benefit that vests over time. Start with what you'd spend on a signing bonus or annual raise.
```

**Annual Additions**:
```
Optional yearly bitcoin purchases to reward tenure. Like 401(k) contributions but with better growth potential. Even small amounts compound significantly.
```

**Growth Assumption**:
```
Your projection for bitcoin's annual price increase. Historical average is 200%, but even 30% growth creates substantial value. Adjust to see different scenarios.

## HISTORICAL PAGE (src/app/historical/)

### Hero Section Rewrite

**Current**: "Learn from Bitcoin"

**NEW HERO**:
```
Headline: "What If You'd Started 5 Years Ago?"
Subheadline: "See real bitcoin performance using actual historical data. No projections, just facts."
```

### Educational Preface

**NEW INTRODUCTORY CONTENT**:

```
Title: "History Doesn't Repeat, But It Often Rhymes"

Looking backward shows us what's possible going forward. While bitcoin's early explosive growth may moderate, its fundamental properties remain unchanged: fixed supply, growing demand, increasing adoption.

**What This Data Shows**

We use actual bitcoin prices from 2015 to today to demonstrate how different benefit strategies would have performed. This isn't cherry-picked data or optimistic projections - it's exactly what happened.

**Understanding Volatility**

Yes, bitcoin is volatile. It has dropped 50% or more multiple times. But zoom out, and every single 4-year period in bitcoin's history has been profitable. Time in the market beats timing the market.

**The Pattern That Matters**

Bitcoin follows a 4-year cycle tied to its "halving" events, when new supply gets cut in half. Each cycle has brought new highs, and institutions are now building positions for the next ones.

Choose your starting year and see for yourself. Even starting at previous market peaks would have generated substantial returns by today.
```

### Results Interpretation

**NEW RESULTS CONTEXT**:

```
**Putting These Numbers in Perspective**

[Dynamic based on calculation]

Your results show a [X]% return over [Y] years. To compare:
- S&P 500 average annual return: 10%
- Real estate average appreciation: 4%
- Gold average annual return: 2%
- Savings account interest: 0.5%

Even in bitcoin's "worst" performing years, patient holders have been rewarded. The key is time horizon - think years, not months.

## BITCOIN TOOLS PAGE (src/app/bitcoin-tools/)

### Hero Section Rewrite

**Current**: "Bitcoin Tools - Simple blockchain tools for everyone"

**NEW HERO**:
```
Headline: "Your Bitcoin Toolkit - No PhD Required"
Subheadline: "Simple tools to explore bitcoin without the complexity. Check transactions, calculate fees, and track addresses with confidence."
```

### Tool Descriptions

**Transaction Lookup**:
```
Title: "Find Any Bitcoin Transaction"

Every bitcoin transaction is public and permanent. Enter a transaction ID to see amounts, confirmations, and fees. Perfect for verifying payments or checking benefit distributions.

What you'll learn:
- Confirmation status (6+ confirmations = fully settled)
- Fees paid (higher fees = faster processing)
- Input/output addresses (who sent what where)
```

**Fee Calculator**:
```
Title: "Smart Fee Estimation"

Bitcoin fees change based on network demand. This tool shows current fee rates so you can choose between fast (expensive) or slow (cheap) transactions. 

Understanding fees:
- Measured in "sats per byte" (satoshis per unit of data)
- Typical transaction: 200-300 bytes
- High priority: 1-2 blocks (10-20 minutes)
- Low priority: 10+ blocks (2+ hours)
```

**Address Explorer**:
```
Title: "Peek Into Any Bitcoin Address"

Bitcoin addresses are like transparent safes - anyone can see the balance but only the owner can open it. Check address balances and transaction history.

Privacy note: While addresses are public, they're not linked to identities unless you share that connection. One person can have unlimited addresses.
```

### NEW SECTION: Bitcoin Basics for Beginners

```
Title: "Bitcoin in Plain English"

**What's a Satoshi?**
The smallest unit of bitcoin, like a penny to a dollar. There are 100 million satoshis (sats) in one bitcoin. When bitcoin hits $1 million, one sat equals one cent.

**What's a Transaction?**
Moving bitcoin from one address to another. Like a wire transfer but faster, cheaper, and works 24/7/365 globally. No banks, no intermediaries.

**What's an Address?**
A long string of letters and numbers that receives bitcoin. Like an email address for money. You can have as many as you want, and they're free to create.

**What's a Wallet?**
Software that manages your addresses and lets you send/receive bitcoin. Think of it as your interface to the bitcoin network, not actual storage (bitcoin lives on the blockchain).

### Hero Section

**NEW HERO**:

Headline: "Your Bitcoin Education Starts Here"
Subheadline: "Everything you need to know about bitcoin benefits, without the hype or complexity"
```

### Section 1: Why Bitcoin Matters for Your Financial Future

```
Title: "The Problem Bitcoin Solves"

Every dollar in your savings account loses value. Every year, inflation eats away at your purchasing power. The $100,000 you saved ten years ago? It buys $78,000 worth of goods today.

Meanwhile, those with assets - real estate, stocks, gold - see their wealth grow. But these traditional assets come with high barriers to entry, complexity, and often poor liquidity.

**Enter Bitcoin: Digital Gold for Everyone**

Bitcoin is the first truly scarce digital asset. Like gold, it can't be printed or inflated away. Unlike gold, you can:
- Buy any amount (even $1 worth)
- Send it anywhere instantly
- Store it yourself securely
- Verify its authenticity immediately

**The Network Effect in Action**

Every day, more people, companies, and countries adopt bitcoin. PayPal, Cash App, and major banks now offer it. El Salvador made it legal tender. Fortune 500 companies hold it as treasury reserves.

This isn't speculation anymore - it's adoption. And we're still early. Less than 5% of the world owns any bitcoin. Imagine being early to the internet, except you can own a piece of the network itself.

**Your Employees Deserve Better Than Inflation**

Traditional benefits are denominated in melting ice cubes (dollars). Bitcoin benefits are denominated in digital gold. Which would you rather receive?
```

### Section 2: Getting Started Safely

```
Title: "Your First Bitcoin Purchase - A Step-by-Step Guide"

**Step 1: Choose Your Exchange**

We recommend starting with River.com for businesses:
- Bitcoin-only focus (no confusing altcoins)
- Zero recurring fees
- Automatic recurring purchases
- Excellent customer support
- Proof of reserves (they can't gamble with your bitcoin)

Alternatives: Cash App (simplest), Kraken (most features)

**Step 2: Set Up Your Account**

You'll need:
- Business bank account information
- EIN/Tax ID
- Basic KYC information (standard for financial services)

Expect 1-3 days for verification.

**Step 3: Make Your First Purchase**

Start small - even $100. Get comfortable with the process:
1. Link your bank account
2. Enter purchase amount
3. Review bitcoin price and fees
4. Confirm purchase
5. See bitcoin in your account immediately

**Step 4: Set Up Recurring Buys**

Dollar-cost averaging reduces volatility risk:
- Weekly buys smooth out price swings best
- Monthly works for smaller amounts
- Set it and forget it

**Step 5: Plan Your Storage**

For amounts under $10,000: Exchange custody is fine
For larger amounts: Consider a hardware wallet (Coldcard, Ledger)
For maximum security: Multi-signature setup with Unchained Capital

Remember: Not your keys, not your coins - but start simple and upgrade security as you learn.
```

### Section 3: Common Questions & Honest Answers

```
Title: "Your Bitcoin Concerns, Addressed"

**"Isn't bitcoin too volatile?"**

Yes, bitcoin is volatile short-term. It can drop 30-50% in weeks. But zoom out: every 4-year period has been profitable. Volatility is the price of performance. Traditional assets are stable because they grow slowly.

**"What if the government bans it?"**

The US has clearly stated bitcoin is property, not a security. It's taxed, regulated, and integrated into the financial system. Banning bitcoin now would be like banning the internet in 1995 - technically possible but economically suicidal.

**"Isn't it used by criminals?"**

Less than 1% of bitcoin transactions involve illicit activity (compare to 2-5% for traditional finance). Bitcoin is actually terrible for crime - every transaction is public forever. Criminals prefer cash.

**"What about environmental concerns?"**

Bitcoin mining increasingly uses renewable energy (over 50% currently) and actually incentivizes renewable development by providing a buyer for excess energy. It uses less energy than Christmas lights or clothes dryers globally.

**"What if employees lose their keys?"**

Use custodial solutions initially. Employees can withdraw to self-custody when ready. Most prefer the simplicity of exchange custody for employer benefits.

**"How are bitcoin benefits taxed?"**

Bitcoin benefits are taxed as property. Employees pay income tax on the value when vested, capital gains when sold. Consult your tax professional, but it's similar to stock options.

**"What if bitcoin goes to zero?"**

After 15 years, multiple crashes, thousands of obituaries, and constant criticism, bitcoin keeps growing. The risk isn't bitcoin going to zero - it's your employees' traditional benefits going to zero through inflation.
```

### Section 4: Success Stories

```
Title: "Real Companies, Real Results"

**MicroStrategy's Bold Move**
In 2020, this business intelligence company started buying bitcoin for their treasury and offering employees bitcoin benefits. Result: Stock up 10x, talent acquisition improved dramatically.

**Small Business Case Study**
A 50-person marketing agency in Austin started offering $1,000 annual bitcoin benefits in 2019. Today, those benefits are worth $8,000+ per employee. Turnover dropped 60%.

**The Restaurant That Paid in Bitcoin**
A Miami restaurant offered servers the option to receive tips in bitcoin. Those who chose bitcoin in 2020 saw their tips appreciate 5x. Word spread, and they now attract the best service staff in the city.

Your story could be next.

## TRACK PAGE (src/app/track/)

### Hero Section

**NEW HERO**:
```
Headline: "Track Your Bitcoin Benefits in Real-Time"
Subheadline: "Watch your vesting progress and current value. No login required, just your bitcoin address."
```

### Purpose Explanation

```
Title: "Why Track Your Bitcoin Benefits?"

Unlike traditional vesting that happens behind closed doors, bitcoin vesting is transparent. You can:

- See exactly how much bitcoin you've earned
- Track current USD value in real-time
- Verify vesting milestones are met
- Plan your financial future with real data
- Share progress with family or advisors

This transparency builds trust between employers and employees. No wondering, no waiting for statements, no surprises.
```

### Getting Started Guide

```
Title: "How to Track Your Benefits"

**What You'll Need:**
Just your bitcoin address (looks like: bc1q...). Your employer should provide this when setting up your benefits.

**Understanding Your Results:**
- Vested Amount: Bitcoin you've fully earned
- Unvested Amount: Bitcoin still being earned
- Current Value: Today's USD worth
- Vesting Schedule: Your timeline to full ownership

**Privacy Note:**
Bitcoin addresses are public, but not linked to your identity unless you share that connection. Consider using a dedicated address just for employment benefits.

**Can't Find Your Address?**
Ask your employer or check:
- Your employment agreement
- Welcome packet from bitcoin benefit setup
- Email from your company's bitcoin exchange
```
