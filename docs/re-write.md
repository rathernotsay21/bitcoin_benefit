# Bitcoin Benefit Site Content Rewrite

## Writing Philosophy

The Yogi Berra quotes establish our voice:
- "The future ain't what it used to be" 
- "When you come to a fork in the road, take it"
- "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is"

These paradoxical truths inform our style: professional but approachable, wise but not preachy, honest about complexity while keeping things simple. We speak to working folks who are smart enough to spot BS and appreciate straight talk.

## HOME PAGE (src/app/page.tsx)

### Hero Section
**Current:** "Reward Loyalty with Sound Money"  
**Proposed:** "Give Your Team Something Real"

**Current Subheading:** "The future ain't what it used to be."  
**Keep As Is** - This Yogi quote is perfect

### Why Bitcoin Benefits Section

**Current Title:** "Forward-Thinking Companies Choose Bitcoin"  
**Proposed:** "Smart Companies Are Making the Switch"

**Current Opening:**
> Traditional benefits packages cost more and deliver less every year. Health insurance premiums rise. 401(k) matches barely beat inflation. Stock options are complex and often worthless.
> 
> Bitcoin is different.

**Proposed:**
> You know the story. Benefits get more expensive, employees get less value. Every year it's the same thing, only worse.
> 
> There's another way.

### Benefits Grid Cards

#### Card 1: Proven Over 16 Years
**Current:** "Since 2009, bitcoin has survived every crisis, crash, and criticism to become a multi-trillion-dollar asset class..."

**Proposed:** "Bitcoin's been around since 2009. It's been declared dead 400+ times. Still here. Now it's a trillion-dollar market that your employees already understand better than you might think."

#### Card 2: A Benefit Employees Value  
**Current:** "Young talent values bitcoin. Use bitcoin to recruit, retain, or reward your team..."

**Proposed:** "Your best people already own bitcoin. They get it. Offering it as a benefit says you get them. That's worth more than another ping-pong table."

#### Card 3: Simple to Implement
**Current:** "No complicated vesting schedules. No lawyers. No administrative nightmares..."

**Proposed:** "Buy it. Hold it. Give it. That's the whole process. No lawyers billing by the hour, no 50-page documents nobody reads. Just value that grows."

#### Card 4: The Bottom Line
**Current:** "While traditional benefits lose value to inflation, bitcoin has the potential to grow significantly..."

**Proposed:** "Your 401(k) match loses to inflation. Bitcoin doesn't. Sometimes the obvious choice is the right choice."

### Choose Your Bitcoin Benefits Plan Section

**Section Intro Current:** "Pick the plan that fits your budget and goals. Each approach has been designed for different business situations and growth stages."

**Proposed:** "Three ways to do this. Pick what works for you."

#### Pioneer Plan
**Current:** "Are you ready to lead? Make a significant upfront contribution and just like the companies that offered early stock options..."

**Proposed:** "Big commitment upfront, bigger potential later. Like being first to offer stock options, except this time everyone can understand what they're getting."

#### Stacker Plan  
**Current:** "Combine a meaningful initial award with annual additions. Like dollar-cost averaging..."

**Proposed:** "Start strong, keep adding. It's like compound interest that actually compounds. Every year counts."

#### Builder Plan
**Current:** "Start small, think big. Make bitcoin benefits affordable with smaller, regular contributions..."

**Proposed:** "Small steps, long journey. Even $100 a month becomes real money over time. Ask anyone who started buying coffee with bitcoin in 2013."

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Start with high-traffic pages (Home, Calculator plans)
- A/B test major changes if possible
- Keep Yogi quotes sacred - they set the tone
- Run everything past someone who's never bought bitcoin
- If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it

Remember: We're talking to people who work for a living and can spot corporate BS a mile away. They deserve better than buzzwords. Give them truth, even when it's complicated.
