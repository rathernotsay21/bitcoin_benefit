## Commands for Metric Collection

```bash
# Check current duplication
npx jscpd src/ --min-lines 5 --min-tokens 50 --format "typescript,tsx"

# Generate detailed report
npx jscpd src/ --reporters "json" --output metrics/

# Check bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Run performance benchmarks
npm run test:performance

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# TypeScript metrics
npx tsc --noEmit --diagnostics
```

## Automated Tracking Script

```typescript
// scripts/track-duplication.ts
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';

async function trackMetrics() {
  const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
  // Run duplication check
  const duplicationResult = await runCommand(
    'npx jscpd src/ --reporters json --silent'
  );
  
  // Parse and save metrics
  const metrics = {
    date,
    duplication: JSON.parse(duplicationResult),
    bundleSize: await getBundleSize(),
    testCoverage: await getTestCoverage(),
    buildTime: await getBuildTime(),
  };
  
  // Append to metrics file
  await fs.appendFile(
    'metrics/duplication-tracking.jsonl',
    JSON.stringify(metrics) + '\n'
  );
  
  console.log('Metrics tracked for', date);
  console.log('Duplication:', metrics.duplication.percentage + '%');
}

// Run daily
trackMetrics();
```
