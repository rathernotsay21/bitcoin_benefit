✅ CORS Issues Fixed
1. Mempool.space API Proxy Created

Route: /api/mempool/address/[address]/txs
Fixed: Direct browser calls to https://mempool.space/api
Result: Server-side proxy eliminates CORS errors

2. CoinGecko API Proxy Created

Route: /api/coingecko
Fixed: Direct browser calls to https://api.coingecko.com
Result: Server-side proxy eliminates CORS errors

3. Client Code Updated

mempool-api.ts: Now uses /api/mempool instead of direct calls
price-fetcher.ts: Now uses /api/coingecko instead of direct calls
All configurations updated to use proxy routes
