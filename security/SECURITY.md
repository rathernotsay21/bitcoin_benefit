## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Bitcoin Benefit seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Contact us directly

- **Email**: security@bitcoinbenefit.com (if available)
- **Alternative**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

### 3. Provide detailed information

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 4. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution timeline**: Varies based on complexity, typically 30-90 days

## Security Measures

### Dependency Management

- **Automated scanning**: Dependencies are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Regular updates**: Security updates are applied promptly
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of security advisories

### Code Security

- **Static analysis**: Code is scanned for security vulnerabilities
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents many runtime errors
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### Build Security

- **Secure build process**: All builds are performed in isolated environments
- **Dependency verification**: All dependencies are verified before installation
- **Supply chain protection**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated for all builds

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS everywhere**: All communications use HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure headers**: Security headers are configured appropriately

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Receipt and initial review**: We review all reports within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate valid reports and determine severity
3. **Development**: We develop and test fixes for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Release**: We release fixes and notify the reporter
5. **Public disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure with the reporter

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review

- All code changes require review before merging
- Security-focused review for authentication and data handling code
- Automated security scanning on all pull requests

### Dependencies

- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in production
- Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Monitor security advisories for all dependencies

### Environment

- Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Tools

- **npm audit**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Advanced vulnerability detection and monitoring
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in code and history
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates

### Manual Review

- Regular security code reviews
- Penetration testing (when applicable)
- Security architecture reviews

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate containment**: Stop the threat and limit damage
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
4. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement fixes
5. **Lessons learned**: Document and improve security measures

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact the development team through the appropriate channels mentioned above.
