# Bitcoin Benefit

A comprehensive Bitcoin vesting calculator and benefits platform designed to help companies implement Bitcoin-based employee compensation packages.

## Overview

Bitcoin Benefit provides employers with tools to design, visualize, and implement Bitcoin vesting schemes for employee retention and compensation. The platform offers both future projections and historical analysis capabilities, with three distinct vesting strategies tailored to different company needs and risk profiles.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Vesting Schemes

The platform includes three pre-configured vesting schemes, each with a unique ID and display name:

- **Pioneer (`accelerator`)**: An aggressive strategy with a large, immediate grant (e.g., 0.02 BTC) to attract top talent.
- **Stacker (`steady-builder`)**: A balanced approach combining an initial grant with annual additions to minimize market timing risk.
- **Builder (`slow-burn`)**: A long-term incentive plan with smaller annual grants over a decade, designed for maximum employee retention.

### ðŸ“Š Interactive Tools

- **Future Calculator**: Projects potential vesting outcomes over 20 years with customizable Bitcoin growth assumptions.
- **Historical Calculator**: Analyzes the actual performance of vesting schemes from 2015 to the present.
- **Real-time Data**: Integrates with the CoinGecko API for live Bitcoin prices, with caching and fallbacks.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilizes Recharts to create dynamic and responsive timeline charts.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows for customization of grant amounts for all schemes.
- **Multiple Cost Basis Methods**: Supports Average, High, and Low cost basis calculations for historical analysis.
- **Performance Optimized**: Features include code splitting, static data generation, and optimized components for a fast user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Netlify
