# Rate Limiting Fix Summary

## Problem
The vesting tracker was hitting CoinGecko API rate limits (429 errors) when fetching historical Bitcoin prices, causing the application to fail or become very slow with exponential backoff retries.

## Root Cause
1. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple API requests were being made simultaneously to CoinGecko
2. **Insufficient Rate Limiting**: The existing rate limiting was too aggressive (1 second intervals)
3. **Batch Processing**: The concurrent processing service was trying to process multiple batches in parallel

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Rate Limiting (`src/lib/on-chain/price-fetcher.ts`)
- **Increased minimum request interval**: From 1 second to 2 seconds between requests
- **Reduced batch size**: From 5 to 3 requests per batch
- **Added global rate limiting**: Maximum 10 requests per minute across the entire application
- **Improved retry logic**: Increased max retries from 3 to 5 with longer backoff times (up to 30 seconds)
- **Sequential processing**: Changed from concurrent to sequential processing within batches

### 2. Concurrent Processing Optimization (`src/lib/on-chain/concurrentProcessing.ts`)
- **Reduced concurrency**: Lowered max concurrent operations from 5 to 2
- **Smaller batch sizes**: Reduced from 10 to 5 items per batch
- **Sequential price fetching**: Removed concurrent batch processing for price requests
- **Increased timeouts**: Extended timeout from 30 to 60 seconds for rate-limited requests

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Progress tracking**: Added detailed progress indicators showing current/total price fetches
- **Better error messages**: More informative console logging for debugging
- **Fallback handling**: Improved fallback price usage when API requests fail

### 4. Store Updates (`src/stores/onChainStore.ts`)
- **Progress state**: Added `pricingProgress` to track fetching progress
- **Progress callbacks**: Integrated progress updates into the UI
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of progress state on reset/completion

### 5. UI Enhancements (`src/app/track/page.tsx`)
- **Progress bar**: Visual progress bar during price fetching
- **Current date display**: Shows which date is currently being processed
- **Better loading states**: More informative loading messages

## Key Changes Made

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
// Before: 1 second interval, 5 concurrent requests
private static readonly MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL = 1000;
private static readonly MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 5;

// After: 2 second interval, 3 sequential requests, global rate limiting
private static readonly MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL = 2000;
private static readonly MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 3;
private static readonly MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 10;
```

### Processing Strategy
```typescript
// Before: Concurrent batch processing
return await this.processInConcurrentBatches(uniqueDates, ...);

// After: Sequential processing
return await OnChainPriceFetcher.fetchBatchPrices(uniqueDates);
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Added progress callback support
static async fetchBatchPrices(
  dates: string[], 
  progressCallback?: (current: number, total: number, currentDate?: string) => void
): Promise<Record<string, number>>
```

## Expected Results
1. **Reduced 429 errors**: Much fewer rate limit violations
2. **Better user experience**: Progress indicators and informative messages
3. **More reliable operation**: Fallback prices when API fails
4. **Slower but stable**: Processing takes longer but completes successfully

## Testing
- Test with multiple vesting grants (5+ years of data)
- Monitor console for rate limiting messages
- Verify progress bar functionality
- Check fallback price usage

## Monitoring
- Watch for "Rate limited, retrying after Xms..." messages
- Monitor "Fetching price for DATE (X/Y)..." progress logs
- Check for fallback price usage: "Using fallback price for DATE: $X"
