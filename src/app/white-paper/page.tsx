          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Executive Summary</h2>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Bitcoin Benefits is a revolutionary platform that enables small businesses to implement Bitcoin-based employee compensation packages with unprecedented simplicity and transparency. In an era of persistent inflation, diminishing purchasing power, and complex traditional benefits administration, we provide a streamlined solution that aligns long-term employee incentives with the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our platform addresses a critical gap in the market: while large corporations have sophisticated compensation tools and crypto-forward companies offer Bitcoin payroll options, small businesses lack accessible, compliant, and user-friendly platforms to offer Bitcoin as a structured long-term benefit. Bitcoin Benefits democratizes access to Bitcoin compensation through intuitive planning tools, transparent vesting calculators, and blockchain-verified tracking systems.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            By leveraging Bitcoin's unique properties—scarcity, decentralization, and proven appreciation history—we enable businesses to offer benefits that have historically outperformed traditional retirement vehicles by orders of magnitude. Our platform transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a structured, trackable, and manageable employee benefit that can drive retention, attract talent, and potentially create life-changing wealth for employees.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Problem: Traditional Benefits Are Failing Small Businesses and Their Employees</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">The Broken Promise of Traditional Benefits</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The traditional employee benefits landscape is fundamentally broken for small businesses and their employees:
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Inflation Erosion:</strong> Traditional 401(k) plans and pensions, while offering tax advantages, struggle to maintain purchasing power against persistent inflation. The average 401(k) return of 7-10% annually barely outpaces real inflation when accounting for housing, healthcare, and education costs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Complexity and Cost:</strong> Small businesses face prohibitive costs and administrative burdens when implementing traditional benefits. Setup fees, ongoing administration, compliance requirements, and fiduciary responsibilities create barriers that leave 48% of small businesses unable to offer any retirement benefits.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Limited Accessibility:</strong> Traditional investment vehicles require minimum contributions, have strict withdrawal penalties, and involve complex vesting schedules that are difficult for employees to understand and track. Young employees especially find these vehicles unappealing and disconnected from their financial goals.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Lack of Transparency:</strong> Employees often cannot easily verify their benefits, track vesting schedules, or understand the true value of their compensation packages. This opacity reduces the perceived value of benefits and diminishes their effectiveness as retention tools.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">The Crypto Payroll Gap</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While cryptocurrency payroll solutions exist, they focus primarily on immediate payment rather than long-term structured benefits:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Current solutions emphasize instant conversion and spending</li>
            <li>No platforms specifically designed for vesting schedules and long-term holding</li>
            <li>Lack of tools for modeling future value and tracking historical performance</li>
            <li>Missing integration with traditional HR and benefits workflows</li>
            <li>Absence of educational resources for employers and employees</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Small Business Disadvantage</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Small businesses face unique challenges that our platform directly addresses:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Resource Constraints:</strong> Limited HR staff and benefits expertise</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Budget Limitations:</strong> Cannot afford enterprise-grade benefits platforms</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Competitive Disadvantage:</strong> Struggle to attract talent against larger companies</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Retention Challenges:</strong> Lack tools to create compelling long-term incentives</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Innovation Barriers:</strong> Want to offer cutting-edge benefits but lack implementation pathways</li>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Proven Track Record Since 2009</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Bitcoin has demonstrated extraordinary resilience and growth over 16 years:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Historical Performance:</strong> From $0.001 to over $100,000, representing unprecedented wealth creation</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Market Maturation:</strong> Evolution from experimental technology to institutional asset class</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Network Effects:</strong> Growing adoption by corporations, governments, and financial institutions</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Infrastructure Development:</strong> Robust ecosystem of exchanges, custodians, and financial products</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Fundamental Properties That Create Value</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Absolute Scarcity:</strong> The 21 million Bitcoin supply cap creates digital scarcity unprecedented in human history. Unlike fiat currencies subject to infinite printing or gold with expanding supply through mining, Bitcoin's supply is mathematically fixed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Decentralization:</strong> No single entity controls Bitcoin, making it resistant to manipulation, censorship, or debasement. This property ensures that employee benefits cannot be arbitrarily devalued by corporate or government actions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Programmable Money:</strong> Bitcoin's transparent blockchain enables perfect verification of vesting schedules, automatic execution of grants, and immutable record-keeping without intermediaries.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Global Accessibility:</strong> Bitcoin operates 24/7/365 across all borders, providing employees with a truly portable benefit that moves with them regardless of employer or location.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Inflation Hedge and Store of Value</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Bitcoin has emerged as "digital gold" with superior properties:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Portability:</strong> Entire wealth transportable via memorized seed phrase</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Divisibility:</strong> Fractional ownership down to 100 millionth of a Bitcoin</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Verifiability:</strong> Instant authentication without third-party validation</li>
            <li><strong className="text-orange-400">Durability:</strong> Immune to physical degradation or loss when properly secured</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Addressing Volatility Concerns</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We acknowledge Bitcoin's volatility and address it through:
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Long-term Perspective:</strong> Vesting schedules of 4-10 years smooth volatility through time averaging. Every 4-year period in Bitcoin's history has shown positive returns.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Dollar-Cost Averaging:</strong> Regular grant schedules naturally implement DCA strategies, reducing timing risk and smoothing entry prices.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Educational Resources:</strong> Comprehensive materials help employees understand volatility as opportunity rather than risk when holding long-term.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong className="text-orange-400">Conservative Projections:</strong> Our calculators use modest growth assumptions (15-50% annually) compared to historical performance (200%+ CAGR), providing realistic expectations.
